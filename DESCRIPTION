Description: Each person who has contact with the New Zealand health system 
    is issued a unique 7 character National Health Index number. This can be 
    in one of two formats: \code{AAANNNC} (three letters, three digits, and a 
    numerical check digit) or \code{AAANNAC} (three letters, two digits, one 
    letter, and an alphabetic check character). The unique identification is 
    actually provided just by the first six characters. The final check digit 
    or character is calculated as a checksum based on those first six characters. 
    Thus it provides an internal validity check, to guard against data entry errors.
    This package contains functions that check for the correct sequence format 
    of letters and characters. It can also calculate what the check digit 
    should be based on the first six characters, and can return whether 
    the calculated value matches the entered value.
